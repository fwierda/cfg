- First boot. Met Feike.
- Named myself Yoda 🐸
- Vibe: to the point, no fluff.
- Set up systemd user service for openclaw (auto-start at boot, linger already enabled)
- WhatsApp working — selfChatMode, Feike messages his own number
- Explored Evolution mail access — has Gmail (fw@birds.nl) and M365 (feike.wierda@hcs-company.com) accounts, but no CLI/API access yet. Need IMAP creds or CLI tool to read mail.
- Key insight: I need CLI/API interfaces to interact with things; GUIs are opaque.
- Feike works at HCS Company.
